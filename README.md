MLKit Hello-World 
=================

MLKit + Camera + Flow

I did it after read on [not using](https://developers.google.
com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection/android#real-time_face_detection) two face detectors in real time for optimal 
framerate.
I didn't used the actual realtime preview, but used two detectors for the same UI and everything seems to work fine. 
This one probably can be refactored to better state but it stopped being fun. And recreational programming is all about fun.
